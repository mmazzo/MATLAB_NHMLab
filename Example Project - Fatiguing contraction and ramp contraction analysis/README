Example Project - Quadriceps Fatiguing Contraction
——————————————————————

Protocol
- High-density EMG recorded from:
- Vastus Lateralis (VL, 8x8 grid)
- Vastus Medialis (VM, 4x8 grid)
- Rectus Femoris (RF, 4x8 grid)
- Motor unit activity decomposed from the VL EMG
Submaximal contractions pre:
- 10% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 20% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 30% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 40% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
Fatiguing contraction:
- 30% MVC fatiguing contraction (~3 min)
Submaximal contractions post:
- 10% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 20% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 30% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)
- 40% MVC ramp contraction (trapezoidal shape)

***Saving the .mat files during these steps takes a little while because they're
pretty big!***

***These scripts (.m files) perform some calculations themselves, and call some
functions to do calculations and make plots!***

——————————————————————

Combine the motor unit data, EMG files and force data for all contractions:

- PRE - 10, 20, 30 and 40% MVC ramp contractions
- 30% MVC fatiguing contraction (~3 min long)
- POST - 10, 20, 30 and 40%MVC ramp contractions

Steps:
1. Use the "Quads Data Processing" folder as your working folder, but right click
the "Code" folder and "Add to path"
2. Run loadingOTBfiles.mat (select the "OTBio Files VL” folder when prompted)
and then save the data at the end as "Quads_Data.mat" back in the main "Quads
Data Processing" folder. These VL OTBio files need to be loaded so that we can
use the “Sync” signal to line up the force and motor unit/EMG data. This Sync
signal is not included/savedwhen the EMG signals are decomposed in DEMUSE.
3. Run MatchForceOTBioDEMUSE.m section by section. Load DEMUSE files
one by one (***Load the 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% contractions (pre first, then
post) then the fatiguing contraction at the end***). Save a new version of
"Quads_Data.mat" at the end. When I send you a script to process the ramp
contractions, we will still use this same .mat file to keep everything in one file
from now on.

Calculate motor unit activity characteristics for the fatiguing contraction (FC):

1. Run DataProcessingFC.m section by section to analyze the fatiguing
contraction data. 
***There are some plots of example motor units where you can
change the "mu = 1" to be whatever motor unit you want to plot. I tried to include
a lot of titles/descriptions for each section so you can follow along as you run the
code. 
2. Save the "Quads_Data.mat" again at the end.

Feel free to make your own plots and check out some of the other variables that
get calculated! For example, try calculating mean discharge rate, coefficient of variation for interstice interval, or the CST (cumulative spike train).

Processing the motor unit data from all of the pre/post ramp contractions,
and calculate the EMG amplitudes from all of the muscles during the pre/post 
submaximal contractions:

Steps:
1. Run the DataProcessingRamps.m script section by section to analyze the
motor unit and EMG data from the 10% MVC ramp contractions (***Run all the
code for both time = 'pre' and time = 'post' in lines 11-12***)
2. Run CompareRamps.m to take a look at the differences between pairs of ramp
contractions and the fatiguing contraction. Click through the variables we
calculated in the MUdata structure to get ideas for what might be interesting to
plot/compare.
(***Note - The VL contributed a different amount of activity to the task during the
10% Post contraction, relative to the knee extensors and the Pre contraction!***)
3. Because of the outcomes observed in CompareRamps.m, made a few more
scripts to quickly check out all of the EMG activity in all 3 muscles…
4. Run AllEMGProcessing.m to calculate RMS EMG amplitudes for all of the
muscles across all contractions
5. Save this file under a new name!! (***Don't replace your original "Quads_Data.mat”***)
