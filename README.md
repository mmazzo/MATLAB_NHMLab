# MATLAB_NHMLab
Package of MATLAB exercises and example code for research assistants in the Neurophysiology of Human Movement Lab at CU Boulder

Example Project - Fatiguing contraction and ramp contraction analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal of Project = Write all the code for a research assistant (RA) to perform data analysis for this side project, while giving them a few “hands on” steps to get them more comfortable with MATLAB. SOme portions of the code are intentionally written in "long format" to make it easier for the RA to understand and translate to their own coding practice.

●	Muscle activity recorded from three quadriceps muscles (VM, VL, RF)
●	Submaximal knee-extension muscle contractions performed before and after a fatiguing contraction at various intensities (10, 20, 30 and 40% of maximum quadriceps strength)
●	Load time series data for knee-extension force (mV), unprocessed muscle activity (EMG) files (OTBio program files, mV) that include an AUX synchronizing pulse signal, and the motor unit activity files (decomposed and edited DEMUSE files)
●	MOTOR UNIT DATA NEEEDS TO BE DECOMPOSED FIRST - Extract, inspect and edit motor unit data with the DEMUSE program
●	Calculates motor unit activity metrics, knee-extension force characteristics and plots various transformations of the data
●	Follow the READ_ME file for detailed steps


Problem set - Introduction to motor unit data analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
●	More open ended questions, guiding the researcher to work through different calculations for basic metrics quantifying motor unit activity
●	Only includes the decomposed and edited DEMUSE file
